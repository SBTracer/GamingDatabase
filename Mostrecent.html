                So finally got this famed mod for RTW over the weekend. It took me a little bit to get used to all of the new units.
                I really enjoyed the change to turns to be seasons instead of half a year. Made it a little slower paced and more interesting.
                The units all look appropriate for the game and the addition of accurate unit shouts helped me get immersed that much quicker.
                The actual combat felt weighty and much more appropriate that it used to. Heavy skirmishers felt like they were heavily armored.</p>
